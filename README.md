## About

[Node-RED][nodered] is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices,
APIs and online services in new and interesting ways.

It provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows
using the wide range of nodes in the palette that can be deployed to its
runtime in a single click.

### Method 2) Automation with Node-RED

**WARNING!** If you've never used Node-RED, [learn more by clicking here.](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-node-red)


We will create a flow in Node-RED to define the theme automatically every time you choose a theme in your interface. It's very simple! Just download the .json file or copy the code and paste it into the Node-RED import window.
